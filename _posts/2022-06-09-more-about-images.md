# More About Images

In the last post I promised some styling, but I'd rather change the way I upload images to blog posts. Instead of coding together an image variable in the markdown front matter, which puts the image in a specific spot on the post defined in `_layouts/posts.html`, I would rather just rely on markdown's own syntax: `![alt text](path "title")`. This way I can place images anywhere I chose in the post, not just at the top of the page:

Good stuff, I've managed to put off styling once again.
