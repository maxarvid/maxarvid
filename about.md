### About
Hi there!

I've been a student, diplomat, lighting designer, toilet scrubber, bar-back, advocate, and a couple of other things. Now I'm a web developer.

Currently I coach a full stack web development bootcamp at [Craft Academy](https://craftacademy.se/). Most of the stuff I do you can find on my [GitHub](https://github.com/maxarvid), it's all in public repos.
